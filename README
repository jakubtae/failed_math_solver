# Math Solver

**Math Solver** is a project currently on hold, aimed at automating the process of completing math homework. Although it was envisioned as a tool to streamline math assignments, limitations were encountered due to the inability of the current AI model (chatgpt-4) to effectively solve most tasks.

## Achievements

1. **PDF Conversion:** Implemented a process to convert PDF files using Poppler with Node.js.
2. **Task Detection:** Developed algorithms to identify taskbars within files based on color and minimum width.
3. **OCR Integration:** Utilized Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract exercise numbers from taskbar images.
4. **Task Segmentation:** Successfully split tasks into smaller images for processing.
5. **Image Preparation:** Connected subtasks into images to provide comprehensive references for the GPT-4 Vision Preview model.
6. **API Integration:** Established API requests to OpenAI for leveraging AI capabilities.

## Challenges and Limitations

The primary setback for this project stems from the inherent limitations of the GPT model in accurately solving complex math problems.

## Future Prospects

Despite the current roadblock, there are potential avenues for the future of this project:

- **Model Advancements:** Monitor advancements in AI technology, particularly in the field of mathematical problem-solving, for improved capabilities.
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Explore hybrid approaches combining AI with human intervention for enhanced accuracy.
- **Collaboration:** Seek collaborations or partnerships with AI research teams or institutions to tackle the challenges posed by complex math problems.
- **Community Contribution:** Encourage contributions from the developer community to iteratively improve the project's functionality and effectiveness.

While the project is on hold, there's potential for future development and innovation to overcome the existing limitations.
