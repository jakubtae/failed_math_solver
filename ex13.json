Here are the solutions:\n\n**Zadanie 13.1:**\n\nThis task requires filling in a table with the correct intervals describing the domain and range of the function, choosing from options A-F.\n\nThe domain (Dziedzina funkcji f) is the set of all x-values for which the function is defined. Looking at the graph, the function is defined from x = -5 to x = 5, including both endpoints. Therefore, the domain is [-5, 5], which corresponds to option E.\n\nThe range (Zbiorem wartości funkcji f) is the set of all y-values that the function can take on. From the graph, the lowest value the function reaches is y = -5 (does not include -5 because there is an open circle on the graph indicating that -5 is not included), and the highest is y = 3 (including 3 because there is a closed circle). Thus, the range of the function is (-5, 3], which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Zadanie 13.2:**\n\nThis task asks to record the set of all solutions to the inequality f(x) < -1.\n\nTo solve this, we look at the graph and identify all x-values for which the function's y-value is less than -1. From the graph, we can see that this is true in two regions: between x = -5 and x = -3, and between x = 1 and x = 3. These intervals are already open (not including the endpoints), which is confirmed by the open circles on the graph at the points (-3, -1) and (1, -1). Therefore, the solution to the inequality f(x) < -1 is:\n\n(-5, -3) ∪ (1, 3).\n\nSo you would fill in the space for Zadanie 13.2 with \"(-5, -3) ∪ (1, 3)\"."
