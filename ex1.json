      "content": "To solve this inequality, let's first consider what |x + 5| means. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering which direction from zero the number lies. This means that |x + 5| is the distance of x + 5 from zero. When we say |x + 5| < 15, we're saying that the distance of x + 5 from zero must be less than 15.\n\nTo find the values that satisfy this inequality, we can consider two casesâ€”when x + 5 is positive and when it is negative:\n\n1. If x + 5 is positive (or zero), the absolute value |x + 5| is just x + 5. So we have:\n   x + 5 < 15\n   Subtract 5 from both sides:\n   x < 10\n   \n   Since x is an integer and positive as per the condition of the problem, x can be any of the positive integers less than 10.\n\n2. If x + 5 is negative, then |x + 5| is -(x + 5) (the negative of x + 5). So we have:\n   -(x + 5) < 15\n   Multiply both sides by -1 and remember to reverse the inequality sign (since multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality):\n   x + 5 > -15\n   Subtract 5 from both sides:\n   x > -20\n   \n   Again, since x is positive, this second case doesn't actually give us any additional valid options beyond the first case.\n\nSo, x can be 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, which gives us 9 possible positive integers that satisfy the inequality |x + 5| < 15.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 9."
